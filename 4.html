        that you won‚Äôt leave me alone no matter what. and from now i promise
        that i‚Äôll try not to fight back when we fight and i‚Äôll just keep hugging
        you even if you push me.i won‚Äôt let you go and i‚Äôll hug you tightly and

        you and cuddle with you forever and i promise to marry only you in the
        future. idk why but im damn sure that we‚Äôll get married to each other
        even if there are some hurdles.i have never written this long paragraph
        before not even for essays in school but today im full of words for you.
        once you said boys once they get confirmation they treat girls like
        paper but im not that kind of a person and you know it better till now i
        treated you like a princess from now on i‚Äôll treat you like my queen my
        angel. You are so special baby you have the power to melt me the one who
        didn‚Äôt even care about girls or relationships . I‚Äôm literally head over
